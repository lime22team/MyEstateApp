    <h1>Terms of Use – MyEstateApp</h1>
    <div class="updated">Last updated: 2025-11-23</div>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the <strong>MyEstateApp</strong> mobile application (“App”), which is designed
      for professional use by real estate offices and their authorized staff. By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility and Authorized Use</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for use by registered real estate offices and their authorized users (e.g., owners, admins, agents, assistants).
      You are responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials,</li>
      <li>ensuring that your use of the App complies with applicable laws and regulations,</li>
      <li>using the App only for legitimate business purposes related to real estate activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Accounts and Access</h2>
    <p>
      You may be required to create an account or be assigned one by your office administrator. You agree to provide accurate and up-to-date
      information. You must not share your account with unauthorized persons or attempt to access other users’ accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the App to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>violate any applicable laws or regulations,</li>
      <li>upload or transmit unlawful, harmful, or defamatory content,</li>
      <li>harass, abuse, or infringe the rights of others,</li>
      <li>attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems or data,</li>
      <li>misuse location data or personal information of clients or staff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Location and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App may request access to device location only while in active use and only with user permission. Location data is used to support
      features such as capturing property locations, providing navigation, and coordinating field operations. Continuous or background location
      tracking is not performed. Use of the App is also subject to our <a href="privacy-en.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which forms part of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The App, including its design, code, logos, and other content, is owned or licensed by the developer and is protected by intellectual
      property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App solely for your office’s authorized business
      purposes. You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or redistribute the App except as expressly permitted by law.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may rely on third-party services (e.g., maps, hosting, database, file storage, authentication). We are not responsible for the content,
      security, or availability of third-party services, but we make reasonable efforts to work with reputable providers.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data and Content Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for the accuracy, legality, and completeness of the data you enter into the App, including property details, client records,
      and documents. You must ensure that you have the necessary rights and consents to store and process such information in compliance with
      applicable data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App
      will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free from security vulnerabilities. You use the App at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of
      or in connection with your use of the App, including loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the App for any user who violates these Terms or misuses the service. Upon termination,
      your right to use the App will cease.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date. Your continued use of
      the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

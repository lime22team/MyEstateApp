    <h1>Privacy Policy – MyEstateApp</h1>
    <div class="updated">Last updated: 2025-11-23</div>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>MyEstateApp</strong> mobile application (“App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses,
      and protects information when used by real estate offices and their authorized users.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for internal use by real estate offices. It is used to manage property portfolios, locations, appointments, clients,
      and related documents. By using the App, you agree to the data practices described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect the following personal information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name or display name</li>
      <li>User role (e.g., admin, agent, assistant)</li>
      <li>Account or login credentials (handled securely by the backend/auth provider)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Portfolio and Client Data</h3>
    <p>
      To support the App’s functionality, we may store portfolio and client-related data, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Property details (area, rooms, floor, age, price, etc.)</li>
      <li>Portfolio notes</li>
      <li>Buyer/seller contact details (as entered by the office)</li>
      <li>Appointments, reminders, and scheduling information</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Photos and Files</h3>
    <p>
      The App allows users to capture, upload, and manage property photos, and generate documents such as PDFs or text files for presentations and contracts.
      Photos may be automatically compressed to reduce device storage usage.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 Location Data</h3>
    <p>
      The App may collect and use precise location data only while it is actively in use and only with explicit user permission. Location data is used to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>capture and verify property locations,</li>
      <li>provide navigation support,</li>
      <li>allow admins to request on-demand location updates from field agents, when necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The App <strong>does not perform continuous or background location tracking</strong>. No location data is collected when the App is closed or running
      in the background.
    </p>

    <h3>2.5 Device Permissions</h3>
    <p>
      The App may request access to certain device features, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Camera (to capture property photos)</li>
      <li>Photos/Media/Files (to attach and store images or documents)</li>
      <li>Contacts (optional, to add or sync client details with the device address book)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Permissions can be managed through the device settings. If you choose not to grant certain permissions,
      some features of the App may not be available.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the App,</li>
      <li>Allow users to manage property portfolios and client information,</li>
      <li>Support appointment scheduling and reminders,</li>
      <li>Generate and share documents (e.g., contracts, presentations),</li>
      <li>Assist with navigation and location-based workflows,</li>
      <li>Improve the usability, performance, and reliability of the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes. Data may be processed by backend service
      providers only to deliver the App’s features (e.g., database, file storage, authentication).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encrypted connections and restricted access controls.
      However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Data is retained for as long as necessary to provide the App’s functionality and as required by the real estate office using the App, subject to
      legal obligations. If you would like your personal data to be deleted, please contact your office administrator or use the contact information below.
      We will respond to valid deletion requests within a reasonable time.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for use by children. It is designed for professional use within real estate offices, and we do not knowingly collect
      personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date. Your continued use
      of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
